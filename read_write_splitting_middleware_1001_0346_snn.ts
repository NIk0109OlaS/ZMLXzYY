/*
 * Documentation:
 *
 * The ReadWriteSplittingMiddleware class is designed to handle read and write operations
 * separately by routing them to different databases based on the HTTP method.
 *
 * - readDB: The database to be used for read operations (GET, HEAD).
 * - writeDB: The database to be used for write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
 *
 * The middleware can be applied to an Oak application, and it will automatically
 * determine whether to use the read or write database based on the incoming request's method.
 *
 * It provides a simple example of how to implement a middleware for read-write splitting,
 * allowing for effective database management in applications that require high
 * read/write performance.
